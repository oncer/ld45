Todo list:

needs fixing:
[?] drag-collisions / detection
[ ] gore stuff flying out of cow corpses (fixed y-position, because if you slam it down really fast they spawn too far below)

think about:
[x] if you try to feed bird again while he's in eating animation: have to move back out and in again for it to be highlighted/possible to feed him again
[ ] endless birds?
[ ] maggot: should disappear after a while?
[ ] bat, pumpkin-human-baby, pumpkins, zombie-pumpkins, etc: what happens if too long there?
[x] bat: where does it stay?

crafting:
[x] pumpkin: put seed onto fresh normal cow-corpse
[x] zombie-pumpkin: put seed onto zombie cow-corpse
[x] big, green pumpkin: feed zombie pumpkin 5 salads

[x] big, green pumpkin given to bird -> maybe bird eats it and transforms into bat?
[x] pumpkin cow: feed normal pumpkin to a normal cow
[x] pumpkin cow-corpse
[x] vampire cow: put bat onto cow -> transforms (poof?)
[x] vampire cow-corpse
[x] salad: put seed onto pumpkin cow-corpse
[x] tomatoes: put seed onto vampire cow-corpse
[x] blood-maggot: give a maggot a tomato
[x] triangle-seed: give bird 3 blood-maggots
[x] corn: give any cow-corpse a triangle-seed
[x] pumpkin-human-baby: give normal pumpkin 2 corn // OLD: give it to zombie pumpkin
[x] human-like cow: give pumpkin-human-baby to normal? cow
[x] human-like cow-corpse
[ ] avocados: put triangle-seed onto human-like cow-corpse
[ ] finished vegan meal (10? salads, 5? tomatoes, 1? avocados)
