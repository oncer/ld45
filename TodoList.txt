Todo list:

needs fixing:
[?] drag-collisions / detection
[ ] gore stuff flying out of cow corpses (fixed y-position, because if you slam it down really fast they spawn too far below)

think about:
[x] if you try to feed bird again while he's in eating animation: have to move back out and in again for it to be highlighted/possible to feed him again
[ ] endless birds?
[ ] maggot: should disappear after a while?
[ ] bat, pumpkin-human-baby, pumpkins, zombie-pumpkins, etc: what happens if too long there?
[ ] bat: where does it stay?

crafting:
[x] pumpkin: put seed onto fresh normal cow-corpse
[x] zombie-pumpkin: put seed onto zombie cow-corpse
[ ] big, green pumpkin: feed zombie pumpkin 5 salads

[ ] bat (comes out of salad pumpkin) // OLD: (big, green pumpkin given to bird -> maybe bird eats it and transforms into bat?)
[x] pumpkin cow: feed normal pumpkin to a normal cow
[x] pumpkin cow-corpse
[ ] vampire cow: put bat onto cow -> transforms (poof?)
[ ] vampire cow-corpse
[x] salad: put seed onto pumpkin cow-corpse
[ ] tomatoes: put seed onto vampire cow-corpse
[ ] blood-maggot: give a maggot a tomato
[ ] triangle-seed: give bird 3 blood-maggots

[ ] pumpkin-human-baby: give zombie pumpkin 2 corn
[ ] human-like cow: give pumpkin-human-baby to normal? cow
[ ] human-like cow-corpse
[ ] avocados: put triangle-seed onto human-like cow-corpse
